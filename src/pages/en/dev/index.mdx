# Projects

Below are some notable things that I've built. Almost all my work is publicly
available either on [GitHub](https://github.com/junikimm717) or my
[personal git server](https://git.junickim.me) and is licensed under the
[GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

I try to work on projects which I think will be somewhat novel or reasonably
useful to me and others. It's usually the latter.

## Search.MAATester.com

import Search from "@assets/search.png";

<Imagelist

A search-as-you-type search engine with 20,000 math olympiad problems from
various sources. React/TypeScript frontend, Go+Meilisearch backend, deployed on
a VPS with Docker.

## PureMOOt

[Description in the MOP page](/mop/#puremoot)

Written in Go with the Discordgo API bindings. Uses a Redis database for low-latency data storage.

## TeXbld

A Python tool to reproducibly compile markup documents using docker and a simple
configuration system. A convenient version manager is also provided.

[Website](https://texbld.com) [GitHub](https://github.com/texbld)

It's also worth noting that I had a less sophisticated predecessor to this project,
[MkTeX](https://github.com/junikimm717/mktex).

## Statically Linked Python

A cursed attempt at creating a statically linked python interpreter. Since
python actually depends a lot on dynamic linking, this required a good amount of
source code monkey patching for it to work. Somewhere along the way, I decided
to cross-compile to a bunch of other CPU architectures, leading me down the
cross-compile toolchain rabbit hole :)

## Ohsmathc.club

A site for our Math Competition Homeroom (which I led during my junior and
senior years at OHS) to coordinate meetups and competitions. Written in
Django, deployed with Docker.

The site you're looking at right now. I spent a significant portion of winter
break 2023 refining it.
