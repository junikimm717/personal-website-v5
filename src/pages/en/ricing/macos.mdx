# MacOS Rices

All dotfiles can be found on
[this GitHub repo](https://github.com/junikimm717/imacdots). I have separate
branches for my MacBook and my iMac.

I will soon be porting my setups over from
[yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/) to
[aerospace](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace), as the latter tends to
suffer frequent update headaches and is quite resource-intensive.

## Featured Projects

[Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/)
[Sketchybar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar)
[Borders](https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders)
