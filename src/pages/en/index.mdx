I'm an undergrad at MIT majoring in Electrical Engineering with Computing
(6-5) with plans to double major in Mathematics (18). I used to be a hardcore
épée fencing main with a dream to represent the US at the Cadet World
Championships; in late 2019, I reached first in my age group. When the pandemic
hit and all training came to a halt, I dove deeper into the worlds of contest
math, web development, and UNIX customization, all of which I found to be just
as rewarding. At the far end of my olympiad journey, I placed 23rd overall in
the 2023 USAMO and attended [MOP](/mop).

Although my olympiad days are behind me, I hope to continue working on
interesting projects that help myself and the people around me. My interests
are wide and continue to expand, but include operating systems (I ran an
[IAP course](/en/6s913) on this topic), compilers,
performance engineering, infrastructure, and web development. The things
I've worked on range from decently applicable to impossibly stupid, and I'm in
it for the ride and to learn as much as possible :). Feel free to reach out!

Career-wise, I'm trying to go for some combination of depth and breadth during
my undergrad years. I've worked as a software engineer in
various startups such as [MathDash](https://mathdash.com) and
[Passes](https://passes.com), as well as a researcher at MIT's
[COMMIT](https://commit.csail.mit.edu/) group and
[KRAFTON](https://www.krafton.ai/en/career/ai-fellowship/)'s research division.

This spring and summer, I will be diving head-first into the world of
performance engineering by taking MIT's performance engineering class, working
at [Systalyze](https://systalyze.com) under Dr. Manya Ghobadi, and researching
performance bottlenecks at startups across the AI stack via [HOF
Capital](https://hofcapital.com)'s 2026 Spring Fellowship.
