I'm a rising sophomore at MIT majoring in Electrical Engineering with Computing
(6-5) with plans to double major in Mathematics (18). I used to be a hardcore
épée fencing main with a dream to represent the US at the Cadet World
Championships; in late 2019, I reached first in my age group. When the pandemic
hit and all training came to a halt, I dove deeper into the worlds of contest
math, web development, and UNIX customization, all of which I found to be just
as rewarding. At the far end of my olympiad journey, I placed 23rd overall in
the 2023 USAMO and attended [MOP](/mop).

Although my olympiad days are behind me, I hope to continue working on
interesting projects that help myself and the community around me. The things
I've worked on range from decently applicable to impossibly stupid, and I'm in
it for the ride and to learn as much as possible :). Feel free to reach out!

Career-wise, I'm trying to cast a wide net of different experiences to make a
choice between industry and academia. I've worked as a software engineer in
various startups such as [MathDash](https://mathdash.com) and
[Passes](https://passes.com), as well as a researcher at Stony Brook's
[IACS](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/) and MIT's
[COMMIT](https://commit.csail.mit.edu/) group. This summer, I'll be working as a
ML research engineer at
[KRAFTON](https://www.krafton.ai/en/career/ai-fellowship/) in Seoul.
