I'm a freshman at MIT planning to major in Math and Computer Science. I used to
be a hardcore fencing main (épée) with a dream to represent the US at the Cadet
World Championships; in late 2019, I reached first in my age group. When the
pandemic hit and all training came to a halt, I dove deeper into the worlds of
contest math, web development, and UNIX customization, all of which I found to
be just as rewarding. At the far end of my olympiad journey, I placed 23rd
overall in the 2023 USAMO and attended [MOP](/mop).

Although my olympiad days are behind me, I hope to continue working on
interesting projects that help myself and the community around me. The math
olympiad community has long been an inspiration for such projects, and I am
working at [MathDash](https://mathdash.live) to help make it the best platform
for training contest math skills!
