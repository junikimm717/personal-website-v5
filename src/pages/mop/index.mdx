# MOP

I attended the 2023 [Mathematical Olympiad Program
(MOP)](https://web.evanchen.cc/mop.html), a free 3-week-long summer camp at CMU, as a
member of the Blue Group. It was easily one of the most transformative
experiences of my life, and I've remained connected to the community there ever
since.

I wrote a Discord bot for our server (Lemonade Shop) that issues random pairs of
people every day; pairs are encouraged to converse in DM's and get to know each
other. PureMOOt also implements anonymous broadcasting and a cursed little game
from Art of Problem Solving called [Reaper](https://aops.com/reaper). People
mostly play blitz rounds because reaping at 3AM is a winning strategy but
terrible for one's health.

## Secret Hitler

On July 17, 2023 (1434/2), the Game Masters---Tiger, Vivian, Neal,
and I---launched a game of Secret Hitler over Discord! This was the second
installment after the Pilot Secret Hitler game (hosted by Advaith).
The game went on for a full month, but the fascists managed to eke out a
victory! Below are the corresponding archives:
