# MOP

In 2023, I attended the [Mathematical Olympiad Program
(MOP)](https://web.evanchen.cc/mop.html), a three-week summer camp held at
Carnegie Mellon University, as a member of the blue group. It was easily one of
the most transformative experiences of my life, and I've remained connected to
the community there ever since.

## PureMOOt

import Puremoot from "./puremootation.png";

<div class="flex justify-center items-center gap-3 m-0 p-0">
<div class="m-0 p-0">
<Image src={Puremoot} width={800} style="width:400px" alt="puremootation" />
</div></div>

I wrote a Discord bot for our server (Lemonade Shop) that issues random pairs of
people every day; pairs are encouraged to converse in DM's and get to know each
other. PureMOOt also implements anonymous broadcasting and a cursed little game
from Art of Problem Solving called [Reaper](https://aops.com/reaper). People mostly play blitz rounds
because reaping at 3AM is a winning strategy but terrible for one's health.

## Secret Hitler

On July 17, 2023 (1434/2), the Game Masters---Tiger Zhang, Vivian Loh, Neal Yan,
and I---launched a game of Secret Hitler over Discord! This was the second
installment after the Pilot Secret Hitler game (hosted by Advaith Avadhanam).
The game went on for a full month, but the fascists managed to eke out a
victory! Below are the corresponding archives:

## Catchphrases

I've been maintaining a living (now mostly dead :sob:) document which contains
the set of most/all catchphrases people used during my three weeks at
Pittsburgh. Expect to [lose the game a lot!](/mop_degen.pdf)
