# Face Analysis Research Group

Since July 2022, when I first attended the Garcia Summer Research Program, I
have been working with Dr. Pawel Polak and PhD candidate Zhikang Dong to better
understand facial muscle movements through computer vision and deep learning
techniques. Recently, I have been implementing a kernel smoothing operator to
target regions of the face corresponding to specific muscle groups.
