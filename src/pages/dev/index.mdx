# Projects

Below are some notable things that I've built. Almost all my work is publicly
available either on [GitHub](https://github.com/junikimm717) or my
[personal git server](https://git.junickim.me).

I try to work on projects which I think will be somewhat novel or reasonably
useful to me and others. It's usually the latter.
