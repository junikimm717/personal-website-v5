# School Setup

import Imagelist from "@components/Imagelist.astro";

## Plain Text

In my freshman year, after suffering through much impostor syndrome, I finally
discovered the power of markup languages with the help of the Open Source cult.

These days, I use markdown (pandoc my beloved) for notes and essays and LaTeX
for anything more complicated. For LaTeX work, I use [a class](/code/juni.cls)
that I hacked together. To build and generate projects for each assignment, I
use [TeXbld](/dev/#texbld).

## Servers

Due to the peculiarities of my workflow, I hacked together a custom
synchronization and backup system. The future of this setup given my looming
move to Cambridge is yet to be decided.

The main storage system involves three servers following the 3-2-1 backup rule.
In my house is a Raspberry Pi (which I won from a programming competition) and a
14-year-old Dell workstation that I revived with FreeBSD. Outside my house, I
have a VPS instance from DigitalOcean.

import Dell from "./dell.jpg";
import RPI from "./rpi.jpg";

<Imagelist
  images={[
    [RPI, "RPI"],
    [Dell, "Dell"],
  ]}
  size={150}
  dim="height"
>
  School servers in the house; the Raspberry Pi and the Dell Inspiron
  respectively.
</Imagelist>

import ST from "./syncthing.png";
import FI from "./fancyindex.png";

<Imagelist
  images={[
    [ST, "Syncthing Dashboard"],
    [FI, "FancyIndex"],
  ]}
  size={400}
  dim="width"
>
  Syncthing Dashboard and Fancyindex browsing respectively, all on the Raspberry
  Pi
</Imagelist>

All three servers sync my schoolwork with each other through `syncthing` and
create backups every 6 hours with `cron` and a script that looks something like
below:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
cd /srv/nfs
ls | sort -n | head -n 30 | xargs -r rm -rf
mkdir -p /srv/nfs/backups/archives
tar -czvf /srv/nfs/backups/archives/$(date +%s).tar.gz ohsg12
```

I can freely edit all my schoolwork on the Raspberry Pi by mounting it on
whatever computer I happen to have through either an nfs or samba mount. The
DigitalOcean droplet can be accessed through samba, although it is password
protected.
