# School Setup

import {Image} from 'astro:assets';

## Plain Text

In my freshman year, after suffering through much impostor syndrome, I finally
discovered the power of markup languages with the help of the Open Source cult.

These days, I use markdown for notes and essays and LaTeX for anything more
complicated. For LaTeX work, I use [a class](/code/juni.cls) that I hacked
together. To build and generate projects for each assignment, I use
[TeXbld](/dev/#texbld).

## Servers

Due to the peculiarities of my workflow, I have hacked together a custom
synchronization and backup system.

The main storage system involves three servers following the 3-2-1 backup rule.
In my house is a Raspberry Pi (which I won from a programming competition) and a
14-year-old Dell workstation that I revived with FreeBSD. Outside my house, I
have a VPS instance from DigitalOcean.

import Dell from './dell.jpg'
import RPI from './rpi.jpg'

<figure>
  <div class="flex justify-center items-center gap-3">
    <Image src={RPI} width={200} alt="Dell" />
    <Image src={Dell} width={200} alt="RPI" />
  </div>
  <figcaption class="text-center">
    School servers in the house; on the left is the Raspberry Pi, on the right is the Dell
    Inspiron.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

All three servers sync my schoolwork with each other through `syncthing` and
create backups every 6 hours with `cron` and a script that looks something like
below:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
cd /srv/nfs
ls | sort -n | head -n 30 | xargs -r rm -rf
mkdir -p /srv/nfs/backups/archives
tar -czvf /srv/nfs/backups/archives/$(date +%s).tar.gz ohsg12
```

I can freely edit all my schoolwork on the Raspberry Pi by mounting it on
whatever computer I happen to have through either an nfs or samba mount. The
DigitalOcean droplet can be accessed through samba, although it is password
protected.
