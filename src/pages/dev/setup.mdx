# Development Setup

## Terminal

I am a very big fan of tmux and oh-my-zsh, which allow me to navigate around my
computer with minimal fuss. For tmux, I have [a hacked script](/code/tmuxs.sh)
included in my `$PATH` which allows me to fuzzy find the project directory of my
choice. The following two lines configure the directories to be searched
(separated by colons) and set up a custom keybinding for me to activate the
script:

```bash
export WORKSPACES=$HOME/Documents:$HOME/docs/programming:$WORKSPACES
bindkey -s "^f" "tmuxs -d 4\n"
```

## Editor Configuration

I use a custom neovim setup with LSP, Telescope, and all the
other goodies baked in. I like the catppuccin color scheme, so that's used. You
can find it [on my git server](https://git.junickim.me/junikimm717/nvim2023).

I've also written a set of vimrc's with features that one would expect from a
modern editor, available [on my git
server](https://git.junickim.me/junikimm717/vim2023). Just `curl -LJ` a vimrc
into `~/.vimrc` and when you open `vim`, setup will occur automatically with no
further intervention.
