# Development Setup

## Terminal

I am a very big fan of tmux and oh-my-zsh, which allow me to navigate around my
computers with minimal fuss. For tmux, I have a [dedicated sessionizer
program](https://github.com/junikimm717/tmuxs)
for fuzzy finding project directories. The following two lines in my zshrc
configure the directories to be searched (separated by colons) and set up a
custom keybinding for me to activate the script:

```bash
export WORKSPACES=$HOME/Documents:$HOME/docs/programming:$WORKSPACES
bindkey -s "^f" "tmuxs -d 4\n"
```

## Editor Configuration

I use a [custom neovim setup](https://github.com/junikimm717/nvim2025) with
LSP integration and theme switching. You can try it via docker.

I've also written a [set of
vimrc's](https://git.junickim.me/junikimm717/vim2023) with my favorite settings
and features that one would expect from a modern editor. They're meant to be
dropped onto newly minted servers or containers for immediate use.

```bash
# Full-featured LSP version (requires git)
curl -LJ https://git.junickim.me/junikimm717/vim2023/raw/branch/master/lsp.vimrc -o $HOME/.vimrc
# Version with minimal plugins (requires git)
curl -LJ https://git.junickim.me/junikimm717/vim2023/raw/branch/master/minimal.vimrc -o $HOME/.vimrc
# No plugins required (good for bare minimal container or vps instances)
curl -LJ https://git.junickim.me/junikimm717/vim2023/raw/branch/master/noplug.vimrc -o $HOME/.vimrc
```

## Preferences

Everything here is just my opinion, and you can theoretically build anything in
any Turing-complete language. That being said, I do find certain frameworks and
languages nicer to work with than others. If I had to start a new project right
now, I would probably choose a subset of the following technologies given they
end up being useful:

- [Golang](https://golang.org); it's the Python of compiled languages; very easy to
  work with (cough cough Rust &gt;\_&lt;), the module system is dead-simple, and
  it's quite performant.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/); good for any web project of
  sufficiently large complexity. There's no magic (a big plus for me), and the
  docs are very helpful.
- [Docker](https://docker.com); the default way to containerize applications.
  It works seamlessly and is quite intuitive to use.
- [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes); reproducible builds
  &hearts; only downsides are that docs are kinda bad and bug fixes on nixpkgs
  take forever to be pushed.
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org); I often have to do nontrivial
  frontend work, and I'm not moving away from the sweet sweet LSP completions
  anytime soon.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) or [SimpleCSS](https://simplecss.org);
  I am never moving back to semantic styles ever again.
- [Astro](https://astro.build); I first used this when writing up PureMOOt
  documentation. It is now my best friend for any content-rich website,
  including this one!
- [React](https://react.dev); First JavaScript framework I learned, used it ever
  since.
