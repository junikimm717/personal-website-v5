# Development Setup

## Terminal

I am a very big fan of tmux and oh-my-zsh, which allow me to navigate around my
computers with minimal fuss. For tmux, I have [a hacked script](/code/tmuxs.sh)
for fuzzy finding project directories. The following two lines in my zshrc
configure the directories to be searched (separated by colons) and set up a
custom keybinding for me to activate the script:

```bash
export WORKSPACES=$HOME/Documents:$HOME/docs/programming:$WORKSPACES
bindkey -s "^f" "tmuxs -d 4\n"
```

## Editor Configuration

I use a custom neovim setup with LSP, Telescope, and all the
other goodies baked in. I like the catppuccin color scheme, so that's used. You
can find it [on my git server](https://git.junickim.me/junikimm717/nvim2023).

I've also written a set of vimrc's with features that one would expect from a
modern editor, available [on my git
server](https://git.junickim.me/junikimm717/vim2023). Just `curl -LJ` a vimrc
into `~/.vimrc` and when you open `vim`, setup will occur automatically with no
further intervention.

## Preferences

Everything here is just my opinion, and you can theoretically build anything in
any Turing-complete language. That being said, I do find certain frameworks and
languages to be nicer to work with than others. If I had to start a new project
right now, I would probably choose a subset of the following technologies given
they end up being useful:

- [Go](https://golang.org); as one of my friends put it, Go is basically the
  Python of compiled languages. It's very easy to work with, the module system
  is dead-simple, and it's very good on all the performance benchmarks.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/); good for any web project of
  sufficiently large complexity. There's no magic (a big plus for me), and the
  docs are very helpful.
- [Docker](https://docker.com); the default way to containerize applications.
  It works seamlessly and is quite intuitive to use.
- [Nix](https://nixos.org); reproducible builds	&hearts; only downsides are that
  docs are kinda bad and bug fixes on `nixpkgs` take forever to be
  pushed.
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org); I often have to do nontrivial
  frontend work, and I'm not moving away from the sweet sweet LSP completions
  anytime soon.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.org) or [SimpleCSS](https://simplecss.org);
  I am never moving back to semantic CSS ever again.
- [Astro](https://astro.build); I first used this when writing up PureMOOt
  documentation. It is now my best friend for any content-rich website.
- [React](https://react.dev); First JavaScript framework I learned, used it ever
  since.
