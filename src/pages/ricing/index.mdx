# Ricing

I was introduced to the world of ricing by my fellow nerds in the Open Source
Cult. Ever since, I have experimented with a variety of different setups and
programs to optimize both productivity and aesthetics. I've riced on both
[MacOS](ricing/macos) and a bunch of [Linux Distros](ricing/linux).

## Software

Below are some pieces of software I use, although I often adventure beyond them!

| Type            | Choice (Linux)      | Choice (MacOS)      |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Terminal        | Alacritty with Tmux | Alacritty with Tmux |
| Shell           | Zsh with oh-my-zsh  | Zsh with oh-my-zsh  |
| Editor          | Neovim              | Neovim/VSCode       |
| Window Manager  | Too many            | Yabai               |
| Document Viewer | Zathura             | Skim                |
| Music           | Mpd with Ncmpcpp    | Mpd with Ncmpcpp    |

## Editor Configuration

My primary workhorse is a custom neovim setup with LSP, Telescope, and all the
other goodies baked in. I like the catppuccin color scheme, so that's used. You
can find it [on my git server](https://git.junickim.me/junikimm717/nvim2023).

I've also written a set of vimrc's with features that one would expect from a
modern editor, available [on my git
server](https://git.junickim.me/junikimm717/vim2023). Just `curl -LJ` a vimrc
into `~/.vimrc` and when you open `vim`, setup will occur automatically with no
further intervention.

## Window Manager Configuration

Whatever desktop I'm on, I always associate each workspace with a certain
type of application. I configure my window manager and status bars accordingly.

1. The terminal emulator. I used to have multiple emulator instances open across
   multiple workspaces, but tmux has made this far less efficient.
2. The web browser
3. Other code editors/productivity tools
4. Chatting/conference software
5. Virtual Machine software; yes, I am a proud VM spammer
6. Music players; apps like YouTube Music or Cantata go here, although I don't
   use them as much because ncmpcpp exists. 6 is correspondingly the most
   annoying digit to reach.
7. Settings
8. Discord
9. Streaming/recording software

## Schoolwork Management

Because I possess multiple computers and do virtually all of my schoolwork on
plain-text files, I have hacked together a custom synchronization and backup
system.

The main storage system involves three servers following the 3-2-1 backup rule.
In my house is a Raspberry Pi (which I won from a programming competition) and a
14-year-old Dell workstation that I revived with FreeBSD. Outside my house, I
have a VPS instance from DigitalOcean. All three servers sync my schoolwork with
each other through `syncthing` and create backups every 6 hours with `tar` and
`cron`.

I can freely edit all my schoolwork on the Raspberry Pi by mounting it on
whatever computer I happen to have through either an nfs or samba mount. The
DigitalOcean droplet can be accessed through samba, although it is password
protected.
