# Ricing

I was introduced to the world of ricing by my fellow nerds in the Open Source
Cult. Ever since, I have experimented with a variety of different setups and
programs to optimize both productivity and aesthetics. I've riced on both
[MacOS](ricing/macos) and a bunch of [Linux Distros](ricing/linux).

## Software

Below are some pieces of software I use, although I often adventure beyond them!

| Type            | Choice (Linux)      | Choice (MacOS)      |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Terminal        | Alacritty           | Alacritty           |
| Editor          | Neovim              | Neovim/VSCode       |
| Window Manager  | Too many            | Yabai               |
| Document Viewer | Zathura             | Skim                |
| Music           | Mpd with Ncmpcpp    | Mpd with Ncmpcpp    |

## Window Manager Configuration

Whatever desktop I'm on, I always associate each workspace with a certain
type of application. I configure my window manager and status bars accordingly.

1. The terminal emulator. I used to have multiple emulator instances open across
   multiple workspaces, but tmux has made this far less efficient.
2. The web browser
3. Other code editors/productivity tools
4. Chatting/conference software
5. Virtual Machine software; yes, I am a proud VM spammer
6. Music players; apps like YouTube Music or Cantata go here, although I don't
   use them as much because ncmpcpp exists. 6 is correspondingly the most
   annoying digit to reach.
7. Settings
8. Discord
9. Streaming/recording software
