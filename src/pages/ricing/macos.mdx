# MacOS Rices

All dotfiles can be found on
[this GitHub repo](https://github.com/junikimm717/imacdots). I have separate
branches for my MacBook and my iMac.

It's worth noting that the features of the window manager that I use, Yabai,
require
[SIP](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection)
to be completely disabled. I honestly can't see the point of keeping SIP enabled
when the robust UNIX permissions system exists...

## Featured Projects
