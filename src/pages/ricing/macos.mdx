# MacOS Rices

All dotfiles can be found on
[this GitHub repo](https://github.com/junikimm717/imacdots). I have separate
branches for my MacBook and my iMac.

It's worth noting that the features of the window manager that I use, Yabai,
require
[SIP](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection)
to be completely disabled. LMAO imagine having to restrict the root user because
people can't manage their permissions correctly...

Make sure that the "automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use"
setting under Desktop & Dock is also turned off.
