# Exposome

I worked with [Dr. Douglas
Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-walker-7662b21b/) and [Dr. Anna R.
Robuck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-robuck-a78b16126/) to create a
framework that screens mass spectrometry results, taken from blood samples, for
organohalogens, many of which are environmental pollutants. I also found
correlations between the presence of these identified compounds and the
occurrence of various liver diseases.
