I'm a senior at Stanford OHS and an incoming freshman at MIT with plans to major
in CS and/or Math. I used to be a hardcore fencing main (épée) with a dream to
represent the US at the Cadet World Championships; in late 2019, I reached
first in my age group. When the pandemic hit and all training came to a halt, I
dove deeper into the worlds of contest math, web development, and UNIX
customization, all of which I found to be just as rewarding. At the far end of
my olympiad journey, I placed 23rd overall in the 2023 USAMO and attended
[MOP](/mop).

Although my olympiad days are behind me, I hope to continue working on interesting
projects that help myself and the community around me. Few things bring greater
satisfaction than someone finding a program I made genuinely useful.

In my free time, I play [Go-Stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-Stop), spam
Rubik's Cube PLL algorithms, and spend too much time on Discord.
