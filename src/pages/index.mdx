I'm an incoming freshman at MIT with plans to major in CS and/or Math. I used to
be a hardcore fencing main (Épée), but, over the course of the pandemic, I
switched to olympiads and computer shenanigans, where I remain to this day. In
my junior year, I placed 23rd overall in the USAMO and participated in the
Mathematical Olympiad Program.

Although retired from olympiads, I continue to program random things in the hope
of feeling productive.

In my free time, I play [Go-Stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-Stop), spam
Rubik's Cube algorithms, and spend too much time on Discord.
